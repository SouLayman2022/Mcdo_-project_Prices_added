## Introduction :
- Macdonad is a large fast food retaurent from usa, i guess you already know that ðŸ˜‰
- on this project we will analyse the nutrition score of each Macdonald menu (refer to it as mcdo)
- the csv file we are using is called : McDo_menu.csv
- link to kaggle datset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts
- the csv was sourced from Kaggle, however i have added a new column called "Prices" that was scraped from a bunch of websites that offres mcdo meals prices, so the data is similar to a real world scenario where you will have wrong values, wrong type and worng formatting
- refer to folder scrapping to find data from websites with respective links in the python script's files
- link to scrapped files on GitHub : https://github.com/SouLayman2022/Mcdo_-project_Prices_added/tree/f75c9725bf8d7a758e91a62c7c674da3c2d7ada2/Scrapping
